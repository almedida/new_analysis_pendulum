<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling of Cancellation of Subscription </h3>
<ul>
<li>Performed a rigorous and detailed EDA to determine the subscriptions that were never active nor cancelled. Investigated the last two events of the cancelled subscriptions and their reasons, and the direct relationship between variables and the variable of interest</li>
<li>Built a model and extracted relevant features using Step AIC and Logistic regression to estimate probability of cancellation</li>
<li>Investigated if Back order contributes to Subscription Cancellation. I found that a day increase in Back order, increases the odds of Cancellation by 33.41%</li>
<li>Predicted the probability of Subscription Cancellation to be 58.72%</li>
<li>Performed Model accuracy check using cross validation with misclassification error of 8.35%</li>
  </ul>
